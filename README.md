# Protected-Routes-with-JWT-Verification
🔒 Protected Routes with JWT Verification
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement Protected Routes using JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication in a full-stack environment.
It ensures that only authenticated users with a valid token can access specific routes, protecting sensitive pages and APIs.

The project consists of:

A Node.js + Express backend for user authentication and JWT generation.

A React frontend that manages user login, stores tokens, and restricts protected routes.

🧠 Key Features

🔐 Secure user authentication using JWT

🚫 Access control for protected routes

💾 Token storage and validation in the frontend

🌐 Full-stack implementation (React + Node.js + Express)

⚙️ Middleware-based token verification

🛠️ Technologies Used

Frontend: React, React Router DOM, Axios

Backend: Node.js, Express, JWT (jsonwebtoken)

Other: CORS, dotenv, bcrypt (optional for password hashing)
